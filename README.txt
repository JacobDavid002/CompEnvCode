When play testing the game, please use the sketch mouse version as it runs correctly. However, this version has bugs with the slingshot element, making it easily breakable and unsuitable for the exhibition. The Sketch Hand version of the game is the preferred option for the show, however, this causes the internal timer for the project to run incredibly slowly which basically breaks the game.
